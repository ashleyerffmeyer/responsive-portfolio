                <p>Chicago bred, Kansas City living</p>
                <p>I’m a creative, detail-oriented Software Developer & Engineer looking for new opportunities to make
                    everyday interesting products that reach wide audiences in innovative ways. I love working in an
                    industry where art and technology converge on to make unique experiences for end users and
                    customers. I enjoy fast paced roles where developers and engineers see the effects of their work
                    immediately and make instant changes based on feedback and innovation.</p>
                <p>My background is in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Management. I have 10 years of program
                    management, Six Sigma, and manufacturing experience. I’m passionate about continuous improvement and
                    persistent learning.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I love to eat and run my way through my adopted hometown of Kansas City. I look
                    forward to Restaurant Week and Rock the Parkway half marathon weekend every year! When I am not out
                    exploring KC, I’m hanging out with my black and tan dachshund named Chunk.</p>
